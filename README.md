# Covid Analysis Project
Hello, this is the repository for Covid-19 analysis project, inspired by  Alex Freberg.

In this project, I will be completing the following tasks:
1. Explore the Data using SQL
2. Building a dashboard using Tableau. For a live version of my dashboard, [check out this link](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidAnalysisProject/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69233484/120920799-da2d9780-c6ea-11eb-89b5-adae8679e59f.png)

3. ... (to be updated)...

All the data, code, and final products of this project will be included in this directory.
